<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>“Poor little thing!” I exclaimed. “Do tell me more.”</p><p>I was anxious to hear the end of this story, with which I had sympathized so much.</p><p>“Well, then at last even my box was sold. I don’t know whether it was daytime or night, for shut up in there I knew nothing about time. I felt myself all shaken up; a little later the box was opened and two big fingers fumbled around inside and rudely grasped one of the sticks, which in this last store I had heard called matches. Then: tric, trac! the head of the stick was struck violently against the side of the box and ffroo! it burned. I jumped with horror and waited anxiously as the little stick was consumed by its own flame between the big fingers. I understood everything at once. This was my destiny!”</p></div> </div>
