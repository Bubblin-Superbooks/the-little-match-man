        <p>“Why are you here?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“Oh, I lived so happily for two hundred and fifty years on the mountain Karniyama in the province of Noto! Now they have cut down the woods up there.”</p>
        <p>“Why?”</p>

Look at me! Just to think, I once had branches ten arms long; and with my roots I could drink from the fountain of Tashira, which was fifty feet away.”</p>
