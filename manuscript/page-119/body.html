        <p>I realized it all too late. I was perfectly distracted when I heard Fiam splashing in the saki, spinning around quite like a top. I drew him out and held him between two fingers to dry, but I couldn’t keep him still. He was so wet he slipped away and skipped about, leaving drops of liquid everywhere, and if I held him tight he pricked me on the nails and kicked desperately.</p>
        <p>Taking a good hold I raised him up so as to look at him near by. The phosphorus on his head had melted and shone palely through my fingers.</p>
        <p>“What have you done?” I said. “A little more and you would have been drowned.”</p>
