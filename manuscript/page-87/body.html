<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>“But, my friend, you are not able to judge.”</p><p>Fiammiferino pinched my ear furiously and howled in a voice that sounded like a whistle, it was so loud and shrill:</p><p>“Don’t contradict me. You must be careful, you know, for if you make me angry I may take fire.”</p><p>I quieted him, talking as gently as I could. I was sorry he had such an inflammable temper, but I suppose the phosphorus was largely to blame.</p><p>I can’t tell you how many other intimate conversations I had with Fiam. When we were alone he always sat astride of my collar, and I usually let him sit there when I was working and writing. I must tell you that he gave me excellent advice, made suggestions, and explained Japanese affairs to me.</p></div> </div>
