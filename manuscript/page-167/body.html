        <p>“Just keep quiet.”</p>
        <p>Three hours later Fiam was completely cured of his cold, and walked carefully, like a person on stilts, around the house.</p>
        <p>But a queer thing had happened. You remember that after the incident of the postage stamps Fiam had always been covered with little gummed pieces of paper showing parts of the Emperor’s face in different colors. The rain had softened the gum, and when he was put in the cotton to dry it had stuck to him, and with all my attempts to get him free I was unable to succeed, so that now my companion was completely covered with thick down, a kind of white fur coat, which made him look like a miniature automobilist.</p>
