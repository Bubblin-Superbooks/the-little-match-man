If I hadn’t been found by you....”</p><p>“Thank you, my friend.”</p><p>“And when you put me in there wrap up my head in cotton; have you any?”</p><p>“No. Let me see; wait. I will take some from the quilt. Will that be all right?”</p><p>“Yes; I’m so afraid of taking fire, you see. Imagine how scared you would be if your head were covered with phosphorus like mine.”</p></div> </div>
