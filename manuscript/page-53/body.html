        <p>“I beg of you, don’t stop. What happened at dawn?”</p>
        <p>“At dawn I heard some noises here and there. I raised my leaves to listen better and heard the sound of animals in flight.</p>
        <p>“I waited to see some of them and to ask questions, and pretty soon out of a hole came a family of boars; father, mother and two sons. I didn’t love wild boars; they are worthless and badly educated beasts that often came around to clean their tusks on my trunk, stripping off all my bark, but this time I forgot all about my hatred and tried to welcome them by holding out a branch. The father boar tore off some leaves and went on without even saying thank you, and all the family followed grunting.</p>
