<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I kept yawning like a dog in front of a fire.</p><p>Trying to forget how tedious it was I began to poke into all the corners of the room, hoping to discover something with which to amuse myself. After a thorough search, all I found was a box of matches. For lack of anything else to do they might help me to pass the time, as I could place them in all sorts of positions, and make any number of interesting designs.</p><p>In the box, however, there were only three, and you know with three matches even a genius canâ€™t make anything but a triangle, the simplest of all the figures in geometry.</p></div> </div>
