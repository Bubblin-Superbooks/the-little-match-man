Every evening I shook my clothes, uselessly repeating my search. I would have given ten years of my life, and paid a large sum of money, to have found him. I blamed myself for not having looked thoroughly; perhaps I had left him on the ground among the coarse Chinese mats of the house in which I had passed the night.</p><p>On the third evening, having a little spare time, I started to develop some instantaneous photographs that I had taken during the journey.</p><p>To my immense surprise Fiam appeared in every picture, or rather his shadow, thrown across each landscape.
